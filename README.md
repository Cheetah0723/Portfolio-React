## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ‚òùÔ∏è

## Setup üîß

From your command line, first clone Dev Portfolio:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Cheetah0723/Portfolio-React

# Move into the repository
$ cd Portfolio-React

# Remove the current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.

Using NPM: Simply run the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install --force

# Start the development server
$ npm start
```

Using Yarn: Be aware of that you'll need to delete the `package-lock.json` file if exists before executing the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the development server
$ yarn start
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` to see the portfolio locally.
The page will reload if you make edits.

## Customization Instructions:

### Step 1 - DATA & IMAGES

- `public/images` contains all the image assets that can be customized on website
- `public/profile` contains all text and info inside json files that can be customized according to need

### (9) Resume Section

- It is a clickable link which opens the link provided (generally drive link of resume file) in the navbar.json under Resume.

### Step 2 - STYLES

Change the color theme of the website -

Go to `/src/theme/themes.js` and change the values of the required components both under lightTheme and darkTheme with your prefered HEX color.

```theme
//Default Values
export const lightTheme = {
  background: '#fff',
  color: '#121212',
  accentColor: '#3D84C6',
  chronoTheme: {
    cardBgColor: 'white',
    cardForeColor: 'black',
    titleColor: 'white',
  },
  timelineLineColor: '#ccc',
  cardBackground: '#fff',
  cardFooterBackground: '#f7f7f7',
  cardBorderColor: '#00000020',
  navbarTheme: {
    linkColor: '#dedede',
    linkHoverColor: '#fefefe',
    linkActiveColor: '#fefefe',
  },
  bsPrimaryVariant: 'light',
  bsSecondaryVariant: 'dark',
  socialIconBgColor: '#121212',
};

export const darkTheme = {
  background: '#121212',
  color: '#eee',
  accentColor: '#3D84C6',
  chronoTheme: {
    cardBgColor: '#1B1B1B',
    cardForeColor: '#eee',
    titleColor: 'black',
  },
  timelineLineColor: '#444',
  cardBackground: '#060606',
  cardFooterBackground: '#181818',
  cardBorderColor: '#ffffff20',
  navbarTheme: {
    linkColor: '#dedede',
    linkHoverColor: '#fefefe',
    linkActiveColor: '#fefefe',
  },
  bsPrimaryVariant: 'dark',
  bsSecondaryVariant: 'light',
  socialIconBgColor: '#fefefe',
};

```

### Step 3 - EXTRA

Go to `public/index.html`. Change _title_ and _logo_ if you want to customize it.

## Deployment üì¶

Once you finish your setup. You need to put your website online!

I highly recommend to use [Vercel](https://vercel.app) because it is super easy.
